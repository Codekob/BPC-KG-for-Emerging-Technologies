## Setup

1. Copy the example environment file and fill in your details:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the .env file to set your email address, this is because the OpenAlex API requires an email for priority access

3. Install dependencies
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
